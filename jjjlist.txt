If the President chooses to adjust the maximum deficit amount when submitting the fiscal year 1994 budget, the President may choose to invoke the same adjustment procedure when submitting the budget for fiscal year 1995. In each case, the President must choose between making no adjustment or the full adjustment described in paragraph (2). If the President chooses to make that full adjustment, then those procedures for adjusting discretionary spending limits described in sections 901(b)(1)(C)\u202f1 and 901(b)(2)(E)\u202f1 of this title, otherwise applicable through fiscal year 1993 or 1994 (as the case may be), shall be deemed to apply for fiscal year 1994 (and 1995 if applicable).\n                        \n                        (C)\n                             When the budget for fiscal year 1994 or 1995 is submitted and the sequestration reports for those years under section 904 of this title are made (as applicable), if the President does not choose to make the adjustments set forth in subparagraph (B), the maximum deficit amount for that fiscal year shall be adjusted by the amount of the adjustment to discretionary spending limits first applicable for that year (if any) under section 901(b) of this title.\n                        \n                        (D)\n                             For each fiscal year the adjustments required to be made with the submission of the President\u2019s budget for that year shall also be made when OMB submits the sequestration update report and the final sequestration report for that year, but OMB shall continue to use the economic and technical assumptions in the President\u2019s budget for that year.\n                        \n                        Each adjustment shall be made by increasing or decreasing the maximum deficit amounts set forth in section 665\u202f1 of this title.\n                    \n                    (2) Calculations of adjustmentsThe required increase or decrease shall be calculated as follows:\n                        (A)\n                             The baseline deficit or surplus shall be calculated using up-to-date economic and technical assumptions, using up-to-date concepts and definitions, and, in lieu of the baseline levels of discretionary appropriations, using the discretionary spending limits set forth in section 665\u202f1 of this title as adjusted under section 901 of this title.\n                        \n                        (B) The net deficit increase or decrease caused by all direct spending and receipts legislation enacted after November 5, 1990 (after adjusting for any sequestration of direct spending accounts) shall be calculated for each fiscal year by adding\u2014\n                            (i)\n                                 the estimates of direct spending and receipts legislation transmitted under section 902(d) of this title applicable to each such fiscal year; and\n                            \n                            (ii)\n                                 the estimated amount of savings in direct spending programs applicable to each such fiscal year resulting from the prior year\u2019s sequestration under this section or section 902 of this title of direct spending, if any, as contained in OMB\u2019s final sequestration report for that year.\n                            \n                        \n                        (C)\n                             The amount calculated under subparagraph (B) shall be subtracted from the amount calculated under subparagraph (A).\n                        \n                        (D)\n                             The maximum deficit amount set forth in section 665\u202f1 of this title shall be subtracted from the amount calculated under subparagraph (C).\n                        \n                        (E)\n                             The amount calculated under subparagraph (D) shall be the amount of the adjustment required by paragraph (1).\n                        \n                    \n                \n                (h) Treatment of deposit insurance\n                    (1) Initial estimates\n                        \n                            The initial estimates of the net costs of federal deposit insurance for fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1995 (assuming full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect on the date of the submission of the budget for fiscal year 1993) shall be set forth in that budget.\n                        \n                    \n                    (2) Reestimates\n                        \n                            For fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1995, the amount of the reestimate of deposit insurance costs shall be calculated by subtracting the amount set forth under paragraph (1) for that year from the current estimate of deposit insurance costs (but assuming full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect on the date of submission of the budget for fiscal year 1993).\n                        \n                    \n                \n                (Pub.
