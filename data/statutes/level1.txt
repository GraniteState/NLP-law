Level 1: Absent a better explanation for the Commission's conclusion that SFPP has recovered its reconditioning costs through the indexed rates, it is unclear how the costs of any multi-year project whose cost is not �known and measurable with reasonable certainty� in advance, 18 C.F.R. �?346.2(a)(1)(ii), could ever be recovered, were this reasoning to be consistently adopted. ? The Commission ruled in Opinion No. 435-A that prospective recovery of SFPP's reconditioning costs would be appropriate because of �benefits that flowed to the system when the costs were incurred,� 91 FERC at 61,518, implying that it initially did not view the rule against retroactive rulemaking as an obstacle because the expenses provided an ongoing benefit that would continue to accrue in future years. ? In light of the Commission's failure to explain why it now considers the rule against retroactive rulemaking (or the filed rate doctrine) to bar recovery, and because no party has briefed this question in any detail, the court remands so that the Commission, if it wishes to continue relying on this reasoning, may better explain it.

In any event, pursuant to the applicable standard of review, any deference that might be owed the EEOC's decision would not require upholding it, in the light of the different result compelled, as discussed above, by GERA's plain language, which reflects that Congress did not intend to create a greater scope of protection for employees of certain state officials than Congress has accorded other employees.

Level 1: Specifically, McDonald's argues that the provisions of the OWBPA must be read as a consistent whole and that Congress's repeated use of the word �program� indicates that subsection (i) limits the universe of potential employees in subsection (ii) to �any class, unit, or group of individuals covered by such program.� The Appellees argue that it is inappropriate to introduce *1246 limitations into subsection (ii). Congress used different words for a reason, they argue; subsection (ii)'s first clause contains no limiting language and therefore requires that employers provide job titles and information for every single eligible employee in the company. Neither interpretation requires much linguistic stretching, and other courts considering related issues have concluded that OWBPA is imprecise and ambiguous.The only fair conclusion, then, is that the OWBPA is ambiguous. since the OWBPA is ambiguous, it is appropriate and necessary to turn to other tools of statutory interpretation.�An important tool in this case is the principle that, where statutes are ambiguous, courts will defer to rules and regulations promulgated by the agency charged with administering the statute, so long as that agency does not act arbitrarily or capriciously or exceed the bounds of authority delegated to it in the statute. See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842�43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); Royal Caribbean Cruises, Inc., 108 F.3d at 293.

Ct. 2339, slip op. at 7. Second, the Court considered the respondent's argument that �� 552.3 and 552.109(a) are inconsistent, and, therefore, � 552.3 should control. 127 S. Ct. 2339, slip op. at 8.

The Court has also addressed the relevance of 29 C.F.R. � 552.3, and has concluded that, although the regulation is valid, 29 C.F.R. � 552.109(a) is controlling on the issue of third party employment.�Consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Coke III, we hold that both �� 552.3 and 552.109(a) are enforceable regulations, and � 552.109(a) controls on the issue of third party employment.�

Level 1: The implementing regulations state that torture is "an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture." 8 C.F.R. � 208.18(a)(2)�[**58]� . The BIA's legal conclusion in J-E-was essentially that only particularly vicious and deliberate acts of cruelty, such as those listed above, and not lesser acts of police brutality, amount to torture. J-E-, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 302. The BIA in effect accepted Haiti's police brutality as cruel and inhuman treatment, but concluded it did not rise to "torture." Id. In light of this undisputed dichotomy in the CAT regulations and our required Chevron deference, we cannot say that the distinction drawn by the BIA and legal conclusions in J-E- are arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.

Level 1: When a particular term is not expressly defined in a statute, the meaning of that term may be discerned by "looking to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy." Warner-Lambert Co. v. Apotex Corp. ,316 F.3d 1348, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2003)�[**35]� (quoting U.S. Nat'l Bank of Or. v. In dep. United States Nat'l Bank v. Independent Ins. Agents of Am., 508 U.S. 439, 455, 113 S. Ct. 2173, 124 L. Ed. 2d 402 (1993)). Although sect ion 1625 does not define "substantially identical transactions," the language of the statute indicates that Congress clearly intended transactions between Customs and multiple parties to be "substantially identical transactions." Section 1625(c) states that when it changes a prior "treatment," Customs "shall give interested parties an opportunity to submit, during not less than the 30-day period after the date of such publication, comments on the correctness of the proposed ruling or decision." 19 U.S.C. � 1625(c) (emphasis added). We think that if the words "substantially identical transactions" in section 1625(c) were only meant to refer, in each case, to prior treatment accorded the person claiming entitlement to the notice and comment process of the statute, as provided in 19 C.F.R. � 177.12(c)(1)(iii)(A), �[*1354]� it is unlikely that Congress would have required that "interested parties" be given notice of the change of a prior "treatment." In our view, use of the words "interested parties"�[**36]� indicates that Congress intended, contrary to 19 C.F.R. � 177.12(c)(1)(iii)(A), that "substantially identical transactions" forming the basis of a "treatment" include transactions other than transactions of just the person before Customs claiming the right to a notice and comment process.

- Although Congress delegated to the Attorney General the discretionary authority to grant or deny an application for an adjustment of status, 8 U.S.C. � 1255(a), Congress did not delegate to the Attorney General the discretion to choose who was eligible to apply for such relief.

Level 1: The sunset provision of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 dictates that the exclusivity prohibition shall cease unless the Federal Communications Commission finds that such prohibition continues to be necessary to preserve and protect competition and diversity in the distribution of video programming. 47 U.S.C.S. � 548(c)(5). The term "necessary," however, is not language of plain meaning. Depending on context, the term can mean anything from "useful" or "convenient" to "indispensable" or "essential." The statutory language of the sunset provision gives little guidance on which definition is most appropriate. The Commission has decided that the prohibition continues to be necessary if, in the absence of the prohibition, competition and diversity in the distribution of video programming would not be preserved and protected. This interpretation is well within the Commission's discretion to interpret statutory language under Chevron.

HN5 Section 2612(a)(1) "entitles qualifying employees to twelve weeks of unpaid leave each year if, among other things, an employee has 'a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee."  light of the foregoing, we conclude thatHN6 the FMLA itself prohibits employers from taking adverse employment actions against employees based on the employee's exercise of FMLA leave. We thus also conclude that the Department of Labor's interpretation of � 2615 in � 825.220 is a reasonable interpretation of the statute and a valid exercise of agency authority. Dollar General acknowledges that Congress delegated authority to the Secretary of the Department of Labor �[**21]�to "prescribe such regulations as are necessary to carry out" the Act, 29 U.S.C. � 2654, and that the Department of Labor's interpretation receives deferential review under Chevron, Appellant Br. at 43-45.

Level 1: The Secretary reads � 476(h) to allow her to reject any constitution that does not "reflect the involvement of the whole tribal community." We consider the question within the framework of Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984). The Secretary's legal interpretation did not come in either a notice-and-comment rulemaking or a formal adjudication, the usual suspects for Chevron deference. We nonetheless believe that Chevron-rather than Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 65 S. Ct. 161, 89 L. Ed. 124 (1944)-provides "the appropriate legal lens through which to view the legality of the Agency interpretation," Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. 212, 222, 122 S. Ct. 1265, 152 L. Ed. 2d 330 (2002), because of the "interstitial nature of the legal question" and the "related expertise of the Agency," id. HN15 We must therefore determine whether Congress has spoken directly to the issue. If it has not, we must defer to the agency's interpretation as long as it is reasonable. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43. �[***12]�We hold that the Secretary's interpretation is a permissible one. 7

Level 1: The primary question presented in this appeal is whether COPRA is the exclusive source of overtime pay for CEOs, and thus is an absolute bar to compensation under FLSA for overtime work not officially assigned but nonetheless required to be performed by CEOs. The government contends that such non-officially assigned (but required) work must be performed for free. The plaintiffs argue that such overtime work, never officially assigned until the Jacksta memorandum required it to be done during regular work hours, is work "suffer[ed] or permit[ted]" under FLSA, see 29 U.S.C. � 203(g), and must be reimbursed under FLSA's overtime provisions. the plain language of the statute clearly indicates that COPRA is not the exclusive source of overtime pay for CEOs.

Level 1: We first consider whether the NPFC's interpretation of the OPA deserves deference. =To determine whether a "responsible party" is entitled to a complete defense based on the act or omission of a third party, the NPFC must evaluate whether the alleged third-party "act or omission occur[red] in connection with any contractual relationship with the responsible party." The NPFC interprets the phrase "act or omission occur[ring] in connection with any contractual relationship" to include acts or omissions occurring in connection with an indirect contractual relationship with the responsible party. Thus, the NPFC has concluded that the phrase includes acts occurring in connection with a commercial fuel delivery even where "a chain of agents or contracts stands between the party delivering the fuel and the party receiving the fuel." Direct privity of contract is not required. Congress has not spoken directly to the precise question at issue. we find that the NPFC's interpretation of the phrase "in connection with any contractual relationship with the responsible party" is based on a permissible construction of � 2703(a)(3). Having determined that the NPFC's interpretation of the OPA is entitled to deference, we find that the agency's determination that the Torm was not eligible for the third-party defense should be upheld, as it was supported by substantial evidence and not arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with �[**19]�law.

Level 1: Plaintiffs assert that the Town was required to give affected employees notice in order to establish a � 207(k) work period �[*16]� and qualify for the public safety exemption.�The text of � 207(k) does not specify that a public employer is required to establish a work period or identify how an employer might do so. Further, the text contains no requirement of notice to the affected �[**13]�employee. 29 U.S.C. � 207(k). t is true that � 207(k)'s text does not prohibit giving notice either. However, Congress expressly delegated responsibility for implementing the statute to the Secretary of Labor, see Moreau, 508 U.S. at 27 �[**14]�(citing 29 U.S.C. � 203), 3 who, after notice and comment, promulgated regulations, see 52 Fed. Reg. 2012; 51 Fed. Reg. 13402 (Apr. 18, 1986). These regulations make it clear the Secretary rejected a notice requirement under � 207(k). Under these circumstances, "Congress clearly 'expect[ed] the agency to be able to speak with the force of law,'" and we "must defer to the regulations' resolution of a statutory ambiguity, so long as it is 'reasonable.'"

It remains only to determine whether the regulations constitute a reasonable interpretation of the statute. As we have discussed above, FAR 31.205�47(b) effectively defines the statutory term �contractor� to include the employees of the contractor.

- Since � 1143a(g) is ambiguous, the second prong of the Chevron analysis comes into play, and the Court must determine if the Secretary's interpretation of the statute is reasonable.�The second Chevron prong requires the court to decide if the regulation represents a �permissible construction of the statute,� and substantial deference is given to the agency's interpretation.�The government argues that the exemption is compelled by Congressional intent to benefit only a very narrow class of community service organizations, namely, those involved in education, law enforcement, and health care. Nothing in the legislative history suggests that Congress intended to encourage retirees to accept positions which would involve �religious instructions, worship or proselytization.� Similarly, nothing in the text of the statute itself suggests that Congress intended to benefit this kind of activity. Under these circumstances, deference is owed to the Secretary of Defense who, through his regulations, has excluded from � 1143a(g)'s definition of service all activities involving �religious instructions, worship or proselytization.� Accordingly, the district court properly held that the regulatory exclusion contained in 32 C.F.R. � 77.3(a) does not violate 10 U.S.C. � 1143a(g).3

Congress did not have occasion to confront the specific question of whether the addition of a new source point on an existing rate cluster would constitute a new rate. ? We thus proceed to the second step of Chevron, and inquire whether the Commission's construction is a reasonable one. ? It is. ? It is certainly permissible to conclude that the addition of a tap to an existing rate structure, completed without any change in the existing shipping rates, does not constitute a new rate. We think that the Commission's conclusion reflects a permissible interpretation of the statute and thus affirm its holding that the rate for shipping from East Hynes is eligible for grandfathering.

Level 1: there is nothing in the text or structure of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.S. � 151 et seq., or in its purpose or legislative history that remotely suggests 47 U.S.C.S. � 316 is limited by 47 U.S.C.S. � 405. And the plain language of 47 U.S.C.S. � 316 does not disclose any such limitation either: 47 U.S.C.S. � 316 vests the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with the authority to modify a license either for a limited time or for the duration of the term thereof, if in the judgment of the FCC such action will promote the public interest, convenience, and necessity. 47 U.S.C.S. � 316(a)(1). While 47 U.S.C.S. � 316 does explicitly restrict the FCC's authority to modify a license, that is, the FCC must find the modification in the public interest, convenience, and necessity, it imposes no express limitation on when the FCC may do so. The significance of the Congress's silence there gains additional meaning when � 316 is compared with 47 U.S.C.S. � 312, which latter section authorizes the FCC to revoke a license or construction permit in certain circumstances. 47 U.S.C.S. � 312(a)(1)-(7). No doubt licensees have a strong and legitimate interest in administrative repose, 47 U.S.C.S. � 405(a), but the Congress gave the Commission the authority in 47 U.S.C.S. � 316 to override that interest if doing so serves the public interest, convenience, and necessity. 47 U.S.C.S. � 316(a)(1)�
